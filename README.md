  # Cloud to local share folder sync with build in local backup.

  The target of the project is to synchronise the Cloud-Based Share Folder with Local Share Folder within the local private network continuously, where synchronisation will work both ways. So that if there are any changes happened within the Local Share Folder (which will be used by local users), they immediately will take a place within the Cloud Share Folder and vice versa.

As soon as the Local Share Folder mos likely will be part of a local FILE server, it should be able to be backed up with no errors and any other problems.

  <b>Tasks to test;

  <b>
   1) Add the Scanner which will monitor the activity within the Share folder. Any time someone accesses the shared folder to modify it (add, delete or edit files within the network folder), the scanner will indicate which changes have been made and when they been made so that the program could do the proper mirroring in any direction.
